                    -What is BMR?-
                </h2>
                <p>
                    *BMR is an acronym to describe basal metabolic rate, or the energy (calories) your body needs to
                    perform
                    basic functions such as breathing, blood circulation, cellular growth, body temperature
                    regulation,
                    hair
                    growth and hormone production.
                </p>
                <h2>-What impacts BMR?-</h2>
                <p>Each person’s BMR is based on a variety of factors, some of which you can control (body
                    composition)
                    and
                    others
                    you can’t control (age, gender, hormones).
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Age:</b> BMR and age are inversely related – children have a higher BMR compared to older
                        adults
                        who
                        have
                        lower BMR. In general, the older you get, the less muscle mass you have. As a result, BMR
                        decreases.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b> Composition:</b> Muscle needs more energy than fat (fatty tissue doesn’t require as much
                        energy), so
                        people
                        with more muscle mass and a lower body fat percentage have a higher BMR.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Body shape:</b> People with a larger body surface (tall and thin) area have a higher BMR.
                        People
                        who
                        are
                        shorter
                        and weigh more have a lower BMR.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Gender:</b> Men usually are taller and have more muscle mass than women, which leads to a
                        higher
                        BMR.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Hormones:</b> Thyroxine, a hormone produced by the thyroid, controls how much energy your
                        body
                        uses.
                        People with
                        higher levels of thyroxine have a higher BMR.

                <br><br>
                <h1 class="faq-question">- WHAT IS A HEALTHY BMR?</h1>
                <p> - This will vary person by person. Since your basal metabolic rate is based largely on involuntary
                    functions like breathing and pumping blood, changes in your day-to-day activity don't do much to
                    raise or lower this number.<br> However, increasing muscle mass does increase BMR, because muscle is
                    metabolically "hungry" and it takes more energy to maintain more muscle. This means that when you
                    have a lot of muscle mass, you'll burn more calories at rest.</p>
                <h1 class="faq-question">-WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BMR AND RMR?-</h1>
                <p> - The term BMR is sometimes used synonymously with RMR, which stands for "resting metabolic rate."
                    The
                    difference is that while BMR only measures basic processes of breathing, blood circulation, and
                    temperature regulation in a completely resting state, RMR also includes energy expended by digestion
                    and non-exercise daily movements, like getting dressed and lifting your fork to your
                    mouth.<br><br>BMR
                    and RMR numbers are typically close enough to be interchangeable, but if you're calculating your
                    needs in order to gain or lose weight, pay attention to which number an equation calls for. If it's
                    based on BMR, you can use the calculator above to get an estimate. If the equation uses RMR, use our
                    RMR calculator, which will give you a slightly higher number.</p>
                <h1 class="faq-question">-HOW CAN I USE MY BMR TO LOSE FAT OR GAIN MUSCLE?-</h1>
                <p> - Once you use your BMR to determine your TDEE, you can make sure that the nutrition plan you follow
                    is
                    appropriate for your level of energy expenditure and that it isn't giving you too many or too few
                    calories. Being armed with this knowledge, rather than guesstimating or blindly following a plan
                    without scaling it to your individual needs, can make or break your muscle gains or fat loss.</p>
