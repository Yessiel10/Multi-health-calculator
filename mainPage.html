                <h3>-BMI Calculator-</h3>
                <p>* The Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator can be used to calculate BMI value and corresponding
                    weight
                    status
                    while
                    taking age into consideration.</p>
                <h3>-Limitations of BMI-</h3>
                <p>* Although BMI is a widely used and useful indicator of healthy body weight, it does have its
                    limitations.
                    BMI
                    is only an estimate that cannot take body composition into account. Due to a wide variety of
                    body
                    types
                    as
                    well as distribution of muscle, bone mass, and fat, BMI should be considered along with other
                    measurements
                    rather than being used as the sole method for determining a person's healthy body weight.</p>

                <h3>-BMR Calculator-</h3>
                <p>*Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is the number of calories you burn as your body performs basic
                    (basal)
                    life-sustaining function. Commonly also termed as Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR), which is the
                    calories
                    burned
                    if
                    you stayed in bed all day. In either case, many utilize the basal metabolic rate formula to
                    calculate
                    their
                    bodyâ€™s metabolism rate.</p>
                <h3>-Limitations of BRM calculator-</h3>
                <p>*The only factor it omits is lean body mass and thus the ratio of muscle-to-fat a body has.
                    Remember,
                    leaner
                    bodies need more calories than less leaner ones. Therefore, this equation will be very accurate
                    in
                    all
                    but
                    the very muscular (will underestimate calorie needs) and the very overweight (will over-estimate
                    calorie
                    needs).</p>

                <h3>-Body Fat Calculator-</h3>
                <p>*Our calculator uses a method involving equations developed at the Naval Health Research Center
                    by
                    Hodgdon
                    and Beckett in 1984.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Measure the circumference of the subject's waist at a horizontal level around the navel for
                        men,
                        and
                        at
                        the level with the smallest width for women. Ensure that the subject does not pull their
                        stomach
                        inwards
                        to obtain accurate measurements.
                    </li>
                    <li>Measure the circumference of the subject's neck starting below the larynx, with the tape
                        sloping
                        downward to the front. The subject should avoid flaring their neck outwards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For women only: Measure the circumference of the subject's hips at the largest horizontal
                        measure.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>-Limitations of Body Fat Calculator-</h3>
                <p>*Body fat scales can be very accurate, but due to the number of factors affecting the reading, expect
                    the result to be off by about 5% for the best scales on the market. To maximise their accuracy,
                    follow their instructions as closely as possible.</p>
